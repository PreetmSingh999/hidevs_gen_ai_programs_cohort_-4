WEEK 4 


1. Install Required Libraries

pip install transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu arize

2. Setup Knowledge Base and Vector Store

import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Sample FAQ data (this should be replaced with actual knowledge base data)
faq_entries = [
    {"question": "How do I reset my password?", "answer": "To reset your password, go to the account settings."},
    {"question": "What are your operating hours?", "answer": "Our operating hours are from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday."},
    # Add more entries here...
]

# Load the embedding model
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Encode FAQ questions
faq_questions = [entry["question"] for entry in faq_entries]
faq_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(faq_questions)

# Set up FAISS index
dimension = faq_embeddings.shape[1]
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
faiss_index.add(faq_embeddings)


Hereâ€™s a basic implementation outline in Python for an AI-Driven FAQ Generator using RAG, with Arize for monitoring hallucinations and Ollama/vLLM for inference. This example uses Hugging Face Transformers and FAISS for retrieval, and assumes a local deployment, so you may need to adjust based on your actual deployment stack.

1. Install Required Libraries


pip install transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu arize

2. Setup Knowledge Base and Vector Store

import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Sample FAQ data (this should be replaced with actual knowledge base data)
faq_entries = [
    {"question": "How do I reset my password?", "answer": "To reset your password, go to the account settings."},
    {"question": "What are your operating hours?", "answer": "Our operating hours are from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday."},
    # Add more entries here...
]

# Load the embedding model
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Encode FAQ questions
faq_questions = [entry["question"] for entry in faq_entries]
faq_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(faq_questions)

# Set up FAISS index
dimension = faq_embeddings.shape[1]
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
faiss_index.add(faq_embeddings)

3. Build RAG Pipeline

from transformers import pipeline

# Generative model (example with Hugging Face model)
generator = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-base")

def retrieve_answer(question, top_k=1):
    question_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])
    distances, indices = faiss_index.search(question_embedding, top_k)
    best_match = faq_entries[indices[0][0]]
    return best_match["answer"]

def generate_faq_response(question):
    # Retrieve context from the knowledge base
    retrieved_answer = retrieve_answer(question)
    
    # Generate a refined response using the generative model
    input_text = f"Question: {question}\nContext: {retrieved_answer}\nAnswer:"
    response = generator(input_text, max_length=50, do_sample=False)[0]["generated_text"]
    return response

4. Integrate Arize for Hallucination Detection

from arize.pandas.logger import Client
import pandas as pd

# Arize API setup
arize_client = Client(
    api_key="YOUR_ARIZE_API_KEY",
    space_key="YOUR_ARIZE_SPACE_KEY"
)

# Log input, generated response, and retrieved context to Arize
def log_to_arize(question, generated_response, retrieved_answer):
    data = {
        "question": question,
        "generated_response": generated_response,
        "retrieved_answer": retrieved_answer,
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame([data])
    arize_client.log(df, model_id="faq-generator", model_version="1.0")

# Enhanced generate response with Arize logging
def generate_faq_response_with_arize(question):
    # Retrieve and generate response
    retrieved_answer = retrieve_answer(question)
    generated_response = generate_faq_response(question)
    
    # Log to Arize
    log_to_arize(question, generated_response, retrieved_answer)
    return generated_response

5. Test the System

# Test the FAQ system
question = "What are your operating hours?"
response = generate_faq_response_with_arize(question)
print("Generated Response:", response)


6. Deployment and Monitoring
Deploy this system in your chosen environment (e.g., Flask API, cloud service). Continuously monitor Arize for any signs of hallucination by setting alert thresholds, comparing retrieved and generated answers, and analyzing potential inconsistencies.

This setup provides a basic FAQ generator using RAG principles, with Arize integrated for hallucination detection. Adjust and expand the knowledge base, retrieval models, and monitoring as necessary for your specific application.
